Cloudwatch logs
----------------
Amazon Redshift logs all of the SQL operations, including connection attempts, queries, and 
changes to your data warehouse. 
These logs can be accessed via SQL queries against system tables(automatically), or optionally
saved to a secure Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) Amazon location, 
or exported to Amazon CloudWatch. 

You can view your Amazon Redshift clusterâ€™s operational metrics on the Amazon Redshift console, 
use CloudWatch, and query Amazon Redshift system tables directly from your cluster.

Frm RS cluster > properties > edit audit logging
Log export type: CloudWatch(recommended)
Export logs: User log, Conection Log & User activity log

--now using editor run some test queries
create user cloudwatch_user with password 'Abcd$1234';
drop user cloudwatch_user;

Services > cloudwatch > logs> loggroups > select '/aws/redshift/cluster/myclusrs/userlog'
--we can click on this log > select log stream ie myclusrs > look at log events (optionally filter events based on 
time or other criteria)

< back and select your /aws/redshift/cluster/myclusrs/userlog , 
we can also 'view log insights' or 'start tailing' for latest events.

Similarly look into other logs..

==================
Explore > metrics > all metrics > choose namespace Redshift > add/view metrics..

==================
in RS cluster
--Query monitoring
By default shows : top 100 queries by duration for last 1 hour
Query history > Times scale shows the timeline.

Now we can select one of the query runs and look in query details or query plan.

we can also only problem steps, long running steps etc.
If there is a possibility of optimizations, this will show up.

We can also look at 'cluster metrics' & explore options..
