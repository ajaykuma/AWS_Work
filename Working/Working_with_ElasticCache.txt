(By default access to this cluster is limited to user who created it)

Can be connected only via EC2 instance (within same vpc) and this needs authorization for EC2 instance to access 
cache cluster..

Grant 'network ingress' to cache cluster.

Services > Ec2 > security groups (use SG used for cache cluster) 
inbound : edit rules
Custom TCP Port range (6379) Source:My Ip
SSH                                 My Ip

To be able to connect to cache cluster, determine the cache node endpoint.
Look for your cache cluster > click under 'Nodes' > get the endpoint

Now launch an EC2 instance
Connect to it
$sudo yum install telnet
$telnet endpoint 6379

<once connected we can issue redis commands>


finally delete the cache cluster and EC2 instance
