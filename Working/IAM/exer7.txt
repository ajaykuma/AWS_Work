Switching to an IAM role through the CLI
When using the CLI we can configure an AWS profile to assume a role. To be able to use AWS profiles, we will need AWS CLI installed with the default profile configured. Please follow this link to configure if it isn’t already configured for you.

Using profiles

Open the AWS config file, which is used for configuring AWS profiles.
This file can be found at ~/.aws/config path in macOS or Linux and at the C:\Users\USERNAME\.aws\config path in Windows.
Create a new profile with the name rdsadmin.
When creating a profile for a role, two keys are required
– Role ARN: It can be found on the role details page
– Source profile: AWS CLI uses the credentials from this profile to assume the role. We will choose the default profile.
[profile rdsadmin]
   role_arn = arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/AWSIAMRoleForRDS
   source_profile = default
Once the config has been updated, we can use the --profile flag with every CLI command to use the assumed role. For instance, we can use the following command to describe all database instances using the assumed rdsadmin role.
aws rds describe-db-instances --profile rdsadmin
To stop using a role (Using profiles)

To stop using the assumed role and return to the original credentials, run the commands without the --profile flag. The AWS CLI defaults to using the credentials from your default profile if the --profile flag is not specified.
