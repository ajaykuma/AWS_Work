AWS Organization
------------
AWS organization helps us in creating a different operational unit(business unit)
so that we can create different isolated accounts [test/QA/dev/prod etc]

search > AWS organization

create an organization 
The accounts listed below are members of your organization. 
The organization's management account is responsible for paying the bills for all accounts in the organization. 

shows >
Root
  >abc (if Operational Unit(OU)created)
  >xyz(management account : account used to do signup)

Select root> actions > create new (organizational unit) > dev-OU
                                                        > test-OU

Now select test-OU > to create accounts within it > add aws account
--so we can create new account
or add existing account (we can add our management acct or any sub accounts created within)

Let's click on create new account

AWS account-name: test-account
email add: info_con@controw.com
IAM role name: OrganizationAccountAccessRole (default)

<refresh the page and check>

if newly account created,doesnot showup in selected OU (for some reason),
move it ..

This account will get an email with aws services..

Now we can login using this account: info_con@controw.com as 'root' account
and for pswd we need to reset it.
remember all these accounts within OU are still connected to main management account.

Now we have one more root account, which belongs to my BU/OU in my organization.
