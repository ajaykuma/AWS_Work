Amazon S3 Batch Job
-----------------
For Large scale operations for Amazon s3 objects
-Create a bucket and upload some data into it
	Say: tstusraj1buck1, Say: tickit files
-Create another bucket which will be our destination bucket
        Say: tstusraj1buck1-dest

-Within your bucket, get into management tab and then inventory

-create an inventory ( which will be used by batch operations to move our files)
 :name > myfileinventoryaj
 :destination bucket: choose a bucket >tstusraj1buck1-dest
 :Output format: csv (s3 can use this format without modifying)
 :Object versions: current
 -->save
Note** Shows - Inventory successfully saved
             - Bucket policy created

Now get into bucket where inventory was created and get the 'manifest.json' file. [may take time]

Working with Batch operations:

-create manifest : choose your path of manifest.json or 
 use a provided manifest file say 'tickitdata.csv' & upload it to your source bucket.
 Note** validate if manifest has right bucket name and list of files
-create job
-choose manifest file 
 Manifest format: CSV
 choose path: s3://tstusraj1buck1/tickitdata.csv
-<object version id for versioning enabled (optional)>
-Choose operation: Copy
-choose output bucket > tstusraj1buck1-dest
 [if needed we may need to check permissions ]
-storage class: standard
-encryption: none
-ACL: as it is
-Tags: as it is
-Metadata: as it is
-Description: as it is
--rest all as it is
--choose destination for 'path to completion report destination'
--permissions (choose a role/create a role to access s3 ) [s3forBatchops]--Note** this role should have permissions to work with S3
---Review

#or create custom manifest in csv format and use it
refer to 'tickitdata.csv' file
